🚚 Shipment App Development Guide
Code Evaluation
✅ What's Good
Clean namespace structure
Proper use of [Authorize] attribute
Consistent naming conventions
Good separation of concerns with MVC pattern
Appropriate use of ActionResult return types
⚠️ Issues to Address
Login method should be GET, not POST - Login page display should be GET
Missing Authentication Logic - No actual authentication implementation
No Role-Based Authorization - All users have same access
No Data Models - Controllers need models for business logic
Missing Dependency Injection - No services or repositories
💡 Immediate Improvements
csharp
// Better structure for Login methods
[AllowAnonymous]
public IActionResult Login()
{
    return View();
}

[HttpPost]
[AllowAnonymous]
public async Task<IActionResult> Login(LoginViewModel model)
{
    // Authentication logic here
    return RedirectToAction("Index");
}

// Role-based authorization
[Authorize(Roles = "Client")]
public IActionResult SendAParcel()
{
    return View();
}
🏗️ Recommended Architecture
Controllers Layer
ClientController - Client-specific actions
CourierController - Courier operations
SpeditorController - Shipment management (Spedytor = Dispatcher/Shipment Coordinator)
AuthController - Authentication & Registration
Models & DTOs
User, Client, Courier, Speditor entities
Parcel, Shipment, DeliveryStatus models
ViewModels for each page
DTOs for API responses
Services Layer
IAuthService - Authentication logic
IParcelService - Parcel operations
IShipmentService - Shipment tracking
INotificationService - Email/SMS notifications
👥 User Roles & Permissions
🛍️ Client Role

🚀 Next Steps
To help you better, I'd recommend sharing:

Your current models/entities structure
Database schema or Entity Framework context
Specific pages you want to implement first
Any authentication setup you already have
I can help you implement each feature step by step as you share more code!
